/*
Example 1:
Input: n = 5, queries = [[2,4],[0,2],[0,4]]
Output: [3,2,1]
Explanation:
After the addition of the road from 2 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 3.
After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 2.
After the addition of the road from 0 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 1.

Example 2:
Input: n = 4, queries = [[0,3],[0,2]]
Output: [1,1]
Explanation:
After the addition of the road from 0 to 3, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 3 is 1.
After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path remains 1.
