/*
Example 1:
Input: commands = [4,-1,3], obstacles = []
Output: 25
Explanation: The robot starts at (0, 0):
1. Move north 4 units to (0, 4).
2. Turn right.
3. Move east 3 units to (3, 4).
The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is (3, 4), which squared is 32 + 42 = 25 units away.

Example 2:
Input: commands = [4,-1,4,-2,4], obstacles = [[2,4]]
Output: 65
Explanation: The robot starts at (0, 0):
1. Move north 4 units to (0, 4).
2. Turn right.
3. Move east 1 unit and get blocked by the obstacle at (2, 4), robot is at (1, 4).
4. Turn left.
5. Move north 4 units to (1, 8).
The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is (1, 8), which squared is 12 + 82 = 65 units away.

Example 3:
Input: commands = [6,-1,-1,6], obstacles = []
Output: 36
Explanation: The robot starts at (0, 0):
1. Move north 6 units to (0, 6).
2. Turn right.
3. Turn right.
4. Move south 6 units to (0, 0).
The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is (0, 6), which squared is 62 = 36 units away.
