Example 1:
Input: s = "101"
Output: 1
Explanation: We can group all the black balls to the right in the following way:
- Swap s[0] and s[1], s = "011".
Initially, 1s are not grouped together, requiring at least 1 step to group them to the right.
Example 2:
Input: s = "100"

Output: 2
Explanation: We can group all the black balls to the right in the following way:
- Swap s[0] and s[1], s = "010".
- Swap s[1] and s[2], s = "001".
It can be proven that the minimum number of steps needed is 2.

Example 3:
Input: s = "0111"
Output: 0
Explanation: All the black balls are already grouped to the right.
