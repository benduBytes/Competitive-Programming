/*
Example 1:
Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.

Example 2:
Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
Output: 7
Explanation: All strings are consistent.

Example 3:
Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]

Output: 4
Explanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.
